# Welcome to Francesca Bartolacci's Data Science Portfolio! 

## Why was this portfolio created?
This portfolio will contain and organize code and projects for the class: **Introduction to Data Science**.
Code created in class, for homework, or for projects will be organzied and filed in this repository.
I hope to utilize this repository as a master key of all of the knowledge I hope to gain from this class.

## What will be in this portfolio?
- This repository will contain different folders to house different content, including, but not limited to...
  - EDA
  - Visudalizations
  - Models

## How will this portfolio be organized?

In addition, I will try to keep important notes and reminders saved in the repository to
  *best prepare for future assignements/assessments* and track what topics and new skills
  we learn in class.

To maintain an organized repository, everything will be **color-coded** and and **dated**
  to track when and what was learned. Overall, I hope to utilize GitHub as a digital
  notebook and turn it into a student-made textbook that is modeled after my personal
  preferences and successful learning/studying habits.
